**Rethinking the Nested U-Net Approach: Enhancing Biomarker Segmentation with Attention Mechanisms and Multiscale Feature Fusion**





### Datasets

#### MoNuSeg - Multi-organ nuclei segmentation from H&E stained histopathological images.
link: https://monuseg.grand-challenge.org/Data/

#### TNBC - Triple-negative breast cancer.
link: https://zenodo.org/records/1175282#.YMisCTZKgow

#### DSB - 2018 Data Science Bowl.

#### EM - Electron Microscopy.

### Data Preprocessing for Training
After downloading the dataset you must generate patches of images and their corresponding masks (Ground Truth), & convert it into numpy arrays or you can use dataloaders directly inside the code. Note: The last channel of masks must have black and white (0,1) values not greyscale(0 to 255) values. 
you can generate patches using Image_Patchyfy. Link : https://github.com/saadwazir/Image_Patchyfy



## Training and Testing

1. Edit the `config.txt` file to set training parameters and define folder paths.
2. Run the `ren-unet.py` file in a conda environment. It contains the model, training, and testing code.

## Configurations
```ini
- Paths for training
-- Define paths for folders that contain patches of images and masks for training.
train_images_patch_dir=/mnt/hdd_2A/datasets/monuseg_patches_augm/images/
train_masks_patch_dir=/mnt/hdd_2A/datasets/monuseg_patches_augm/masks/

- Paths for testing
-- Define paths for numpy arrays that contain patches of images and masks for testing.
test_images_patch_dir=/mnt/hdd_2A/datasets/monuseg_test_patches_arrays/monuseg_org_X_test.npy
test_masks_patch_dir=/mnt/hdd_2A/datasets/monuseg_test_patches_arrays/monuseg_org_y_test.npy

-- Define paths for folders that contain full-size images and masks for testing.
image_full_test_directory=/mnt/hdd_2A/datasets/monuseg_org/test/image/
mask_full_test_directory=/mnt/hdd_2A/datasets/monuseg_org/test/mask/

- Training Parameters
training=False
gpu_device=0
num_epochs=2
batch_size=6
imgz_size=256

- Evaluation Parameters
-- Parameters for processing patches of images and masks:
patch_img_size=256
patch_step_size=128

resize_img=True #set resize_img=False if full image sizes have different width and height.
resize_height_width=1024



-- Parameters for processing full-size images and masks:
resize_full_images=True #if resize_full_images=False then full-size images are not scaled down, but evaluation takes more time.
